# Contains models to be estimated with DNN. Some models have been pretrained, in others there is only the architecture so they have to be trained from scratch.
- squeezenet_keras_224_224: only architecture, needs to be trained
	- source: https://github.com/DT42/squeezenet_demo/blob/master/model.py
- cnn_keras_224_224: already trained with in data_1
	- source: https://github.com/cena0805/ros-traffic-light-classifier
- squeezenet_tf_227_227: trained with a multipurpose database, needs bo be further trained with traffic light images
	- source: https://github.com/DT42/squeezenet_demo
	- tools: contains scripts to further train this pretrained squeezenet model with traffic light information

- squeezenet_keras_tf_32_32: trained with bosch database, using keras then exporting to .pb format, and for three categories (green, red and yellow)
